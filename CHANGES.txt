Changes for lovely.buildouthttp
===============================

2011/03/01 0.4.1:
=================

- exclude empty lines form .httpauth, this fixes issue 3.

2010/12/29 0.4.0:
=================

- Allow the inclusion of the .httpauth file from within the buildout itself.
  This adds to the realms set in ``~/.buildout/.httpauth``

=================

- bugfix: make git credentials work without any basic http auth
  definitions

2010/10/11 0.3.6:

2010/10/09 0.3.5:
=================

- the github download credentials are now also added for
  zc.buildout.download based recipies. this allows to use github
  private download urls with any download recipe, such as
  hexagonit.recipe.download

- moved to github http://github.com/lovelysystems/lovely.buildouthttp

2010/09/28 0.3.4:
=================

- fixed behavour with python 2.6+. python 2.6 suddenly counts ``failed`` requests
  but each request without auth counts as one, that makes buildout fail on
  every 5th download in a single run.
  I found this on windows, but should fail on linux too.
